TapsUI
======

This is a pretty major plugin, designed to make taps easier to use and keep
a handle on. It is also, however, pretty grab and go.

It comes with the following features:

* Auto-updating friends list on the left side of the screen
* Pages and Whispers go to separate chat area at top of screen
* Automagically fixes the 'OMG, its been a while since you gave us your email' message
