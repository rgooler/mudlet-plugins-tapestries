Mudlet scripts
==============

These are a bunch of tapestries-specific mudlet scripts I use, and keep here
for backup purposes, and to share with others. If you find them useful,
please let me know! I go by jippenfaddoul in taps.


Requirements
============

Requires Mudlet 2.0b4 or higher. If you are running the stable version, get
the beta out of the forums.

These are also only tested on the windows version of mudlet, but should work
anywhere.


Installation Instructions
=========================

# Download the repo. For ease of use, just click the "ZIP" button below the
  description, and unpack it somewhere.

# Find the plugin(s) you want to install.

# Enter the directory containing said plugins.

# Zip all *.xml files in said directory

# Open Mudlet, and click on the "Scripts" button. Looks like a pencil and paper

# Click 'Import', which is two green down arrows

# Choose the zip file you just created.
